This is the exercise file from Plurlsight course.
Aside form the original files, I provid a jupyter notebook for each exercise for better study result.
URL for this course: https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/keras-deep-learning
The reason I post it is to make me more familiar with the function of Keras and give me some hint when I review it.

1* datasets 
	Keras provide several datasets including:
	Imgae: 
		MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR 10, CIFAR 100
	Text:
		IMDB, Reuters
	Regression:
		Boston Housing Price
	To see how to use the datasets provided by Keras, "fashion_mnist" in "06 building convolutional neural nets" gives a demo for it.

2* Pre-trained model
	Also, keras provides several pre-trained model like Inception-v3, which you can use directly or tune it for better utilization. The demo also in the "Transfer learning" in "06 building convolutional neural nets".

3* Specail layers and functions
	Finally, this tutorial review some special functions and layers in "08 using-specialty-layers-and-functions" which may be used in the future exploration.
